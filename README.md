SE - Software Engineering
SD - Software Development
The purpose would be for you to have the opportunity to work in a team, and develop your SE skills,  starting from idea to product. So you'll have to work in a team, there will be a project and you'll need to deliver it. We'll track it along all the steps in the so called "Software development process"
At first we'll focus on:
o	Requirement analysis and Requirement validation
o	We'll try to use modeling and different kind of models along all SoftDev phases
-  Analyse, design, implementation, testing, release …
We want to use SE tools and mechanisms to help us
validate the idea and to make sure we truly understand the problem and we're not gonna exceed the “budget”
design, implement and test the idea
Basically we'll try to follow the some best practices in the SD process 

You'll need to understand the benefit of using UML  and use it anytime you feel it will help you
For instance another SE tool that you need to use should help you speed up the data persistency implementation:
you'll use an SQL DB and you will auto-generate the DB schema (code first approach) e.g: Hibernate
 
Form teams of up to 5-6 people (recommended 5-6),
One of you will act as a team leader which will be responsible for the team's delivery. 
the team lead needs to come up with:
a timeline of the app development process
distribute tasks
in the end will need to provide grades for all the team members (we'll discuss this a bit later, there are some limitations obviously).

Each team needs a GIT repo where you'll collaborate to develop the app (add me to it as well :) )
Note: Regardless of the task distribution, every team member should be aware of what others do on the project and answer questions regarding the project.
 
What you need to deliver:
Besides the app functionalities, you'll need to create a documentation containing:
o	Functional Model (in general use case diagrams) and detailed using sequential diagrams for each use case
o	Analysis model ( class/es diagram)
o	Projection model (class diagram including the ones you interact from different frameworks)
o	Testing model
o	User manual
o	App development schedule ( including any corrections in terms of planning)
o	And the final presentation (ppt)
 
By its nature the app is web based, so please make sure you'll make a clear difference between apps layers (frontend/backend/business/persistency etc)
But, if you feel like a web app it's too much at this point, there is an alternative: desktop app.
